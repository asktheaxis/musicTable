9/10/2019 created this branch to start figuring out what to use for our backend.

So far, Firebase seems like a good candidate. 
Amazon Web Services would also be a good option, but given both are free for now I am assuming Firebase
will be easier to integrate with Google stuff.

I got the app to talk to Firebase and merged the pull request to give the production branch that baseline.
The commits from today rework how to add an album to the database, as well as clearing out the old HTTP server and pusher code.
I also deleted the other 2 activity.java files for records and moved everything to MainActivity for now. 

The plan is to get base functionality, and then break methods out and create new activities as needed.

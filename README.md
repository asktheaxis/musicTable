The primary goals of this project will be to; complete an Android application that gives 
users a fun and interactive environment to recommend their favorite TV shows, albums, etc. 
to other users; and to expand heavily on the applicationâ€™s current features and design. 

These expansions will include; to allow more content than music, user profiles/permissions, 
API data from related services (IMDB, Spotify, etc.), and to heavily improve the 
applications UI. We also will be migrating the applications database/server to 
Google Firebase.
